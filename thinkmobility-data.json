The belts have four large padded vertical handles. The belts are normally used with two Carers working together, but if necessary, one Carer with training can work alone, depending on the patient. When fitted, and used correctly the Handi-Lift/Walk Belt should not ride up. With the Miracle Grip the lining will grip on the patient's clothing.</p>\n<p>However, it is possible the patient's clothing can ride up if not fitted properly. Be particularly careful not to tumble dry the belt as this could damage the Miracle Grip. Sometimes with a pendulous bust it may be better to use the Pelican Soft Transfer Belt, as this has a narrow belt and buckle and may be easier to fit around the waist. Consult your Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist or Back Care Specialist when using Manual Handling Products. Wipe with disinfectant.</p>\n<p>Hand or machine wash, up to 80\u00b0C.

It can be used in a variety of ways to help people in bed.<br><br>The foam from the Bed Wedge Small Pelican [Pel117] has a waterproof material cover that can be wiped clean and placed in a pillowcase for patient comfort. It can be useful between patient\u2019s legs to prevent pressure.<br><br>There is a wide flap along one edge which can be folded under.

This provides good support for the lower back/posterior to lean against. A normal pillow can also be used for upper back support.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Bed Anti-Slide Wedge:</em> When the person is sitting up in bed, place the Bed Wedge under the legs hard up against the groin. The Wedge will comfortably help the person to stay in position sitting up, and help prevent them sliding back down the bed. This is particularly useful as it can save the Carers having to constantly lift patients back into position.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Bed Anti-Roll Wedge:</em> This may help people who need to sleep on their side but will roll onto their backs. Place the wedge against their back. This will not be uncomfortable, but it will prevent them rolling onto their back. The Bed Wedge is very stable and small enough to go under the bed clothes.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Bed Cradle Wedge:</em> To take the weight of the blankets off the person\u2019s feet, place the Bed Wedge at the bottom of the bed, under the covers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>Cleaning</strong></h5>\n<p><span>Wipe clean with a hospital grade disinfectant. Wipe dry. Ensure the product is dry before using or storing.</span></p>", "vendor": "Pelican", "product_type": "Bed Attachments", "created_at": "2020-03-06T12:00:52+10:00", "handle": "bed-wedge-small-pelican-pel117", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:50:04+10:00", "published_at": "2020-06-03T10:06:05+10:00", "template_suffix": "", "published_scope": "web", "tags": "brand:Pelican, Brand_Pelican, category:Bed Positioning, Category_Bed Positioning, catID:13, contract:DVA, Contract_DVA, product_category:encoded:BED+WEDGE, product_sub_category:encoded:BED+WEDGE, size:Small, Size_Small, subID:384", "variants": [{"id": 43245665058990, "product_id": 4407617257585, "title": "Default Title", "price": "136.00", "sku": "PEL117", "position": 1, "compare_at_price": "", "fulfillment_service": "manual", "inventory_management": "shopify", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "created_at": "2022-08-15T05:49:59+10:00", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:50:04+10:00", "taxable": false, "barcode": "9349145001802", "grams": 0, "image_id": null, "weight": 0.0, "weight_unit": "kg", "requires_shipping": true}], "options": [{"id": 5733438554225, "product_id": 4407617257585, "name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "images": [{"id": 14052511416433, "product_id": 4407617257585, "position": 1, "created_at": "2020-03-06T20:39:22+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-03-06T20:40:18+10:00", "alt": "Bed Wedge Small Pelican [Pel117] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Bed-Wedge-_Small-Pelican-Pel117.jpg?v=1583491218", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 14052511383665, "product_id": 4407617257585, "position": 2, "created_at": "2020-03-06T20:39:22+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-03-06T20:40:27+10:00", "alt": "Bed Wedge Small Pelican [Pel117] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Bed-Wedge-_Small-Pelican-Pel117_1.jpg?v=1583491227", "variant_ids": []}], "image": {"id": 14052511416433, "product_id": 4407617257585, "position": 1, "created_at": "2020-03-06T20:39:22+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-03-06T20:40:18+10:00", "alt": "Bed Wedge Small Pelican [Pel117] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Bed-Wedge-_Small-Pelican-Pel117.jpg?v=1583491218", "variant_ids": []}}},{"product": {"id": 2120080719985, "title": "Bib Coverall Large Blue [223Lb]", "body_html": "<p>The Bib Coverall Large Blue [223Lb] is made from material to protect the clothes and absorb liquid spills.</p>\n<p>It has a lightweight water-resistant backing to help prevent the liquid soaking through.

It can be taken to a patient if an emergency evacuation is needed, particularly in a multi-storey building when lifts cannot be used in case of a fire.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely Encloses the legs and arms. This prevents people from reaching out whilst begin rescued, and possible impeding the rescue.</li>\n<li>Strong, thick Hook &amp; Loop Tape straps.</li>\n<li>Padded head pillow. Especially good for going down stairs.</li>\n<li>Full length mini mattress. Also excellent for going down stairs.</li>\n<li>Automatically fits to size.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><b>To Use</b></h4>\n<p>Take the ResQmat to the patient. Remove the strap that is around the ResQmat and un-fold the ResQmat.</p>\n<p>When putting the patient on top of the ResQmat, place their head on the pillow with their shoulders close to the edge of the pillow. The oversize pillow is to protect the patient\u2019s head when going around corners.</p>\n<p>The methods outlined below are only some suggested ways of getting the patient onto the ResQmat. Your manual handling advisor may have a better suggestion for this task.</p>\n<h4><b>If the patient is in bed</b></h4>\n<p>Log roll the patient to place the ResQmat under them. It is better to place the side of the ResQmat with the soft Hook and Loop Tape under the patient. If the side with the Red Shortening Strap is tucked in first under the patient the Red Shortening Strap may catch underneath the patient.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><b>If the patient is in a chair</b></h4>\n<p>Place the ResQmat on the floor in front of the chair with the pillow near the patient\u2019s feet. If they are in a wheelchair, apply the brakes, remove the foot plates or swing them out of the way. Lift the patient\u2019s legs to pull them, so they slide down into the ResQmat. This is easier if a second Carer can hold the patient under the arms to help them slide, remember this is only used for an emergency evacuation. It also may be possible to stand the patient and have the ResQmat near the chair to lay the patient onto the ResQmat. There may not be enough Carers, so always ask your Manual Handling Advisor to learn a safe method for patients and Carers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><b>When the patient is on the ResQmat</b></h4>\n<p>Firmly wrap the sides of the ResQmat over the patient and secure the Hook &amp; Loop Tape onto the opposite side. Start nearest the feet. Make sure the RED Shortening Strap is clear of the patient\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>The patient\u2019s feet should be inside the V section of the Red Strap. After the four Hook &amp; Loop Tape fastenings are firmly done up, pull the Red Strap from the foot of the sheet through the buckle near the chest, so the length of the ResQmat is made shorter as it pulls into the patient\u2019s feet. Use one hand to push the Red Strap into the buckle and the other hand to pull the Strap away from the buckle. Then close the clamp latch to secure the strap. Even if the webbing is not neatly in the buckle and some webbing is over the edge, the buckle should still close and lock the webbing. By shortening the length of the ResQmat it helps secure the patient when they are taken down stairs feet first.</p>\n<p>There is a second pulling strap located under the pillow and this can be used to help lower someone from a bed or if it is necessary, to pull from the head end of the ResQmat. This strap can be used to help the descent if going down stairs; on stair landings; turning around corners etc. In most evacuations this pulling strap will be kept out of the way, by storing it under the pillow. As there is less strain to pull from the foot end, only use the head pulling strap if necessary.</p>\n<p>The patient should be pulled clear of the building to a designated muster area approved by your facility.</p>\n<h4><strong>Maintenance</strong></h4>\n<p>We recommend you inspect annually, to ensure vermin have not caused any damage. The\u00a0direction of the corrugations on the plastic board means that it\u2019s not necessary to unroll it every few months.</p>\n<p>These ResQsheets are stored under the patient\u2019s mattress on the bed. The patient is then evacuated with their mattress.</p>\n<p>It is important that all staff have manual handling training in using the ResQmat, so they will know how to use it in an emergency. When training, it may be better to stop the training by the escape door, because if the ResQmat is dragged across a driveway the bottom surface may be scratched beyond repair. Proposed escape routes should be trialed for evacuation in different directions depending on where the fire may start. It may be necessary to move some furniture to allow more room to move.</p>\n<p>This item is not suitable for most spiral staircases.</p>\n<ul></ul>", "vendor": "Pelican", "product_type": "Living Aids General", "created_at": "2018-11-15T06:50:12+10:00", "handle": "resqmat-evacuation-mat-220p", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:02:26+10:00", "published_at": "2018-11-15T06:50:12+10:00", "template_suffix": "", "published_scope": "web", "tags": "brand:Pelican, Brand_Pelican, catID:27, product_category:encoded:TRANSFER+AIDS, product_sub_category:encoded:TRANSFER+AIDS, subID:343, swl:120kg, Swl_120kg, type:Special Solutions, Type_Special Solutions, weight:5kg, Weight_5kg", "variants": [{"id": 43245547323566, "product_id": 1908734296177, "title": "Default Title", "price": "701.64", "sku": "220P", "position": 1, "compare_at_price": "", "fulfillment_service": "manual", "inventory_management": "shopify", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "created_at": "2022-08-15T05:02:24+10:00", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:02:26+10:00", "taxable": false, "barcode": "220P", "grams": 5000, "image_id": null, "weight": 5.0, "weight_unit": "kg", "requires_shipping": true}], "options": [{"id": 2684715499633, "product_id": 1908734296177, "name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "images": [{"id": 5963135254641, "product_id": 1908734296177, "position": 1, "created_at": "2019-10-04T05:22:04+10:00", "updated_at": "2019-10-04T05:22:04+10:00", "alt": "Resqmat Evacuation Mat [220P] - Think Mobility", "width": 640, "height": 420, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/resqmat-1.jpg?v=1570130524", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 6504389804145, "product_id": 1908734296177, "position": 2, "created_at": "2019-10-04T17:36:25+10:00", "updated_at": "2019-10-04T17:36:25+10:00", "alt": "Resqmat Evacuation Mat [220P] - Think Mobility", "width": 800, "height": 800, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/ResQmat-2.png?v=1570174585", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 6504390623345, "product_id": 1908734296177, "position": 3, "created_at": "2019-10-04T17:36:25+10:00", "updated_at": "2019-10-04T17:36:25+10:00", "alt": "Resqmat Evacuation Mat [220P] - Think Mobility", "width": 800, "height": 800, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/ResQmat-5.png?v=1570174585", "variant_ids": []}], "image": {"id": 5963135254641, "product_id": 1908734296177, "position": 1, "created_at": "2019-10-04T05:22:04+10:00", "updated_at": "2019-10-04T05:22:04+10:00", "alt": "Resqmat Evacuation Mat [220P] - Think Mobility", "width": 640, "height": 420, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/resqmat-1.jpg?v=1570130524", "variant_ids": []}}},{"product": {"id": 2120082063473, "title": "Bed Side Wedge Pelican [469]", "body_html": "<p>The Bed Side Wedge Pelican [469] are used to help prevent someone from falling out of bed.</p>\n<p>They are suitable for patients who need a reminder not to roll out of bed.

They are normally used with people who stand up from a chair or get out of bed and could fall over. Sometimes the patient may be able to walk but due to dementia and mobility issues, they may put themselves or others in danger.</p>\n<p>Floor Alarms are the most recommended products in our alarm range for people getting out of bed.

It can be used in a variety of ways to help people in bed.</p>\n<p>The foam has a waterproof material cover that can be wiped clean and placed in a pillowcase for patient comfort. It can be useful between patient\u2019s legs to prevent pressure.</p>\n<p>There is a wide flap along one edge which can be folded under. The advantage of this flap is to allow air to move slightly when someone is lying on it. This means that it doesn\u2019t feel like lying on a balloon.</p>\n<p>This product is available with Hook Tape (hook, rough side) on the bottom. This attaches to the sleep positioning bed material if you use that.</p>\n<h5><strong>Some Uses For The Bed Wedge</strong></h5>\n<p><em>Bed Back Support:</em> When sitting up in bed, the Bed Wedge can be placed behind the person\u2019s back. This provides good support for the lower back/posterior to lean against. A normal pillow can also be used for upper back support.</p>\n<p><em>Bed Anti-Slide Wedge:</em> When the person is sitting up in bed, place the Bed Wedge under the legs hard up against the groin. The Wedge will comfortably help the person to stay in position sitting up, and help prevent them sliding back down the bed. This is particularly useful as it can save the Carers having to constantly lift patients back into position.</p>\n<p><em>Bed Anti-Roll Wedge:</em> This may help people who need to sleep on their side but will roll onto their backs. Place the wedge against their back. This will not be uncomfortable, but it will prevent them rolling onto their back. The Bed Wedge is very stable and small enough to go under the bed clothes.</p>\n<p><em>Bed Cradle Wedge:</em> To take the weight of the blankets off the person\u2019s feet, place the Bed Wedge at the bottom of the bed, under the covers.</p>\n<h5><strong>Cleaning</strong></h5>\n<p><span>Wipe clean with a hospital grade disinfectant. Wipe dry.

This popular belt is just one of many manual handling aids we supply for use when transferring patients. The security of the double Velcro belt is very supportive for patients.</p>\n<p>The belt can be made with a Miracle Grip lining that will grip to clothing very well. The belts have four large padded vertical handles. The belts are normally used with two Carers working together, but if necessary, one Carer with training can work alone, depending on the patient. When fitted, and used correctly the Handi-Lift/Walk Belt should not ride up. With the Miracle Grip the lining will grip on the patient's clothing.</p>\n<p>However, it is possible the patient's clothing can ride up if not fitted properly. Be particularly careful not to tumble dry the belt as this could damage the Miracle Grip. Sometimes with a pendulous bust it may be better to use the Pelican Soft Transfer Belt, as this has a narrow belt and buckle and may be easier to fit around the waist. Consult your Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist or Back Care Specialist when using Manual Handling Products. Wipe with disinfectant.</p>\n<p>Hand or machine wash, up to 80\u00b0C. Do not tumble dry or wring. Air dry only. Inspect frequently for signs of wear.</p>\n<p><b>General Manual Handling Warning:</b><span>\u00a0Manual Handling products are designed to assist carers to help patients. They will not make the carer stronger or fitter, but with correct training and use of the products, should make manual handling easier and safer for both staff and patients. When training, practise with an able-bodied colleague. If any procedure is not comfortable or is difficult and puts the carer or patient in a dangerous position, the participants should call out to stop the manoeuvre, recover and recommence. Never jeopardise your health by straining, twisting or being incorrectly positioned when manual handling. Always select the most appropriate equipment for the patient\u2019s current condition and if in doubt, use mechanical equipment. Ask your Manual Handling adviser for individual guidance.</span></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Item #</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Waist (cm)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Waist (inches)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Lining</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Handles</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>518X</td>\n<td>Extra Small</td>\n<td>58cm -

The foam offers some protection if hit by the patient.</p>\n<p>If the patient\u2019s arm or leg goes over the top of the rail, the\u00a0top of the Bed Rail Protector will fold over giving protection.

The material next to the person is a soft medical-grade vinyl material. Staff can wipe it clean for hygiene. The outside is a printed polycotton material. The material print changes depending on availability. We do try to keep the print as unisex as possible.</p>\n<p>The Mediflextra material is a hospital-grade material. It is used to help with protection against urine, feces, vomit, blood, etc. Remove the cover for washing if necessary. Wiping it clean is normally sufficient.

They are normally used with people who stand up from a chair or get out of bed and could fall over. Sometimes the patient may be able to walk but due to dementia and mobility issues, they may put themselves or others in danger.</p>\n<p>Floor Alarms are the most recommended products in our alarm range for people getting out of bed. This is because they generally give the earliest warning of when someone is getting out of bed. When someone goes to get out of bed, they can have the weight of their feet on the alarm, setting it off before they actually lift their bottom off the bed. If they were using the<span>\u00a0</span>Bed Alarm\u00a0that is placed on top of the mattress, it will not sound until after the patient gets out of bed.

There are two ties to secure it in place around the mattress.</p>\n<p>Normally you want to place it so the hips and shoulders are on the alarm pad. This is so there is enough weight going through the pad as someone turns, and shifts weight between the hips and shoulders.</p>\n<p>There is a built-in delay of about 1/2 second. This is so that if someone is just changing position there should not be any false alarms.</p>\n<p>Some people under 40kg / 90lbs may not be heavy enough for this product to work.</p>\n<h4>General Alarm Information</h4>\n<p>Patient Stand Up alarms can be a very helpful way of monitoring a patient without physical or chemical restraining. They are normally used with people who stand up from a chair or get out of bed and could fall over. Sometimes the patient may be able to walk but due to dementia and mobility issues, they may put themselves or others in danger.</p>\n<p>Floor Alarms are the most recommended products in our alarm range for people getting out of bed. This is because they generally give the earliest warning of when someone is getting out of bed. When someone goes to get out of bed, they can have the weight of their feet on the alarm, setting it off before they actually lift their bottom off the bed. If they were using the<span>\u00a0</span>Bed Alarm\u00a0that is placed on top of the mattress, it will not sound until after the patient gets out of bed.

The non-slip tape is not really necessary, as the Slide Boards do not move a lot when they are correctly positioned. Non-slip tape can make it harder to position the Slide Board under a patient, and to remove the board after the transfer. If the Slide Board is used upside down, the non-slip tape will stop the person from moving. By not having any non-slip tape the Pelican Slide Boards they can be used either way up.</p>\n<p>Also the non-slip tape can make it difficult to keep clean, particularly if the patient is incontinent or there may be some other cross infection reason. Remember if the person is sitting on a chair, or on a bed or operating table and the Slide Board is put under them, the Slide Board can be contaminated on both sides i.e. the top and bottom of the Board. This can be from the patient's clothing, and from where they are sitting on the chair, bed, etc. as the chair will also be contaminated. If the non-slip tape is on the underside of the board, it means the board cannot be easily wiped clean.</p>\n<p>If a customer particularly wants non-slip tape, this can be purchased from most hardware shops and the customer can easily put non-slip tape on the Boards.</p>\n<p><strong>Slide the Patient \u2013 Not the Board</strong></p>\n<p><span>Remember:</span><span>\u00a0</span>Slide the patient across the board.

The extra slipperiness of the material takes a lot less effort to \u2018slide and turn\u2019, rather than turning on standard bed sheets.

The Turn Yourself Sheet will reduce the friction under the shoulders and hips when turning.</p>\n<p>This material is thin and breathable. Its stays in position well with a very strong breathable foam that will withstand commercial washing.</p>\n<h5>To Use</h5>\n<p>Lay the Turn Yourself Sheet on the bed with the black breathable foam pad, face down. This black foam helps anchor it in place to prevent it moving during the night. Spread the Turn Yourself Sheet out on either side of the foam section on the bed. Position the Sheet with the top part just under the pillow to ensure it is under the person\u2019s shoulders. The bottom part will then be under the person\u2019s thighs, ensuring the hips will also be on top of the Turn Yourself Sheet. Most people sleep directly onto the breathable fabric, but another sheet can be placed on it if desired. This may be for people who are allergic to nylon.</p>\n<p>When turning in bed, the person can use their legs to start turning or may even use their arms as well. The top layer of the Turn Yourself Sheet will move under the person reducing the normal friction under the body. The extra material that is on either side of the foam pad will slide under the person as they turn. This leaves a little of the material in front of them, but with extra material behind them. When they turn again, onto either their back or onto their other side, the surplus material that was behind them will pass under them during the turn.</p>\n<p>Some patients with disturbed sleeping habits may make the foam section curl over during the night.

There is a central raised padded section that protects the legs from touching when lifting or lowering. The Carers can lift the patient\u2019s legs by hand or use a hoist.</p>\n<p>This product may help some Bariatric people or people with Oedema have problems getting their legs onto a bed.</p>\n<p>Lower the bed so when the patient sits down, they will be able to place their bottom as near to the middle of the bed as possible. Show the patient where they should sit, so when they are lying down, their head will be on the pillow. If the bed does not lower, as an ensemble bed has a fixed height, then the patient may be able to stand on a block to make them taller, so their bottom will go back further on the mattress. Pelican make different sizes of Bed Steps (sold separately). The height of the steps needed will depend on the height of the patient or the bed. The steps are big enough for the patient to stand on and turn around though some people may need assistance. The patient should sit safely on the side of the bed before lifting their feet. Ensure they will not slip off.</p>\n<h5>How to use<br>\n</h5>\n<p>Place the Leg Lifter behind the patient\u2019s ankles and lower calves, with the central section between the legs. If lifting by hand hold the lowest loops, one in each hand, so the legs are not squashed together when lifting. Start to lift by taking the feet away from the side of the bed a little, so the Leg Lifter does not simply ride up under the knees. Then lift the legs high enough to clear the mattress and walk around to the end of the bed and gently place the legs on the bed. If a folded Slide Sheet is placed at the foot end of the bed, it may be possible to slide the feet to the middle of the bed, to reduce the amount of lifting.<b><span>\u00a0</span>Always have at least two people lifting heavy legs.<span>\u00a0</span></b>The Carers should hold one side each of the lifter so the patient\u2019s legs are not being squashed together.</p>\n<p>If using a hoist to lift, fit the Leg Lifter webbing to the Spreader Bar. If the hoist does not lower enough, then use the longer loops. When starting to lift the legs, move the hoist away from the side of the bed a little, so the Leg Lifter does not ride up under the knees. Once the legs are high enough to clear the mattress then move the hoist so the patient\u2019s legs will be on the bed. Practise with the hoist before lifting the legs, to make sure the hoist will fit around the bed legs. Remove the Leg Lifter carefully. If the patient can bend and open their knees, remove from between the legs.</p>\n<h5>Video</h5>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mHJM0eEZl0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>", "vendor": "Pelican", "product_type": "Living Aids General", "created_at": "2019-09-05T02:00:15+10:00", "handle": "leg-lifter-bariatric-oedema-233", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:47:11+10:00", "published_at": "2019-09-05T02:00:15+10:00", "template_suffix": "", "published_scope": "web", "tags": "application:Bariatric, Application_Bariatric, brand:Pelican, Brand_Pelican, catID:27, condition:After Stroke Care, condition:Oedema, Condition_After Stroke Care, Condition_Oedema, product_category:encoded:TRANSFER+AIDS, product_sub_category:encoded:TRANSFER+AIDS, subID:343, swl:450kg, Swl_450kg", "variants": [{"id": 43245659717806, "product_id": 4071695974513, "title": "Default Title", "price": "235.00", "sku": "233", "position": 1, "compare_at_price": "", "fulfillment_service": "manual", "inventory_management": "shopify", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "created_at": "2022-08-15T05:47:08+10:00", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:47:11+10:00", "taxable": false, "barcode": "233", "grams": 0, "image_id": null, "weight": 0.0, "weight_unit": "kg", "requires_shipping": true}], "options": [{"id": 5286139592817, "product_id": 4071695974513, "name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "images": [{"id": 14279149781105, "product_id": 4071695974513, "position": 1, "created_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:56+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:58+10:00", "alt": "Leg Lifter Bariatric/ Oedema [233] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Leg-Lifter-Bariatric-oedema-233_4.jpg?v=1587024658", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 14279149748337, "product_id": 4071695974513, "position": 2, "created_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:56+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:57+10:00", "alt": "Leg Lifter Bariatric/ Oedema [233] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Leg-Lifter-Bariatric-oedema-233_5.jpg?v=1587024657", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 14279149879409, "product_id": 4071695974513, "position": 3, "created_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:56+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:58+10:00", "alt": "Leg Lifter Bariatric/ Oedema [233] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Leg-Lifter-Bariatric-oedema-233_1.jpg?v=1587024658", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 14279149846641, "product_id": 4071695974513, "position": 4, "created_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:56+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:58+10:00", "alt": "Leg Lifter Bariatric/ Oedema [233] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Leg-Lifter-Bariatric-oedema-233_2.jpg?v=1587024658", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 14279149813873, "product_id": 4071695974513, "position": 5, "created_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:56+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:58+10:00", "alt": "Leg Lifter Bariatric/ Oedema [233] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Leg-Lifter-Bariatric-oedema-233_3.jpg?v=1587024658", "variant_ids": []}], "image": {"id": 14279149781105, "product_id": 4071695974513, "position": 1, "created_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:56+10:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-16T18:10:58+10:00", "alt": "Leg Lifter Bariatric/ Oedema [233] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Leg-Lifter-Bariatric-oedema-233_4.jpg?v=1587024658", "variant_ids": []}}},{"product": {"id": 2262833561713, "title": "Adl - Falls Prevention Stand Up Alarm Floor Alarm Pelican (S10854) [444F]", "body_html": "<p>It generally gives the\u00a0earliest\u00a0warning of when someone is getting out of bed to try to walk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Stand Up Floor Alarm is placed on the floor next to the bed.

They are normally used with people who stand up from a chair or get out of bed and could fall over. Sometimes the patient may be able to walk but due to dementia and mobility issues, they may put themselves or others in danger. Floor Alarms are the most recommended products in our alarm range for people getting out of bed. This is because they generally give the earliest warning of when someone is getting out of bed. When someone goes to get out of bed, they can have the weight of their feet on the alarm, setting it off before they actually lift their bottom off the bed.

The non-slip tape is not really necessary, as the Slide Boards do not move a lot when they are correctly positioned. Non-slip tape can make it harder to position the Slide Board under a patient, and to remove the board after the transfer. If the Slide Board is used upside down, the non-slip tape will stop the person from moving. By not having any non-slip tape the Pelican Slide Boards they can be used either way up.Also the non-slip tape can make it difficult to keep clean, particularly if the patient is incontinent or there may be some other cross infection reason. Remember if the person is sitting on a chair, or on a bed or operating table and the Slide Board is put under them, the Slide Board can be contaminated on both sides i.e. the top and bottom of the Board. This can be from the patient's clothing, and from where they are sitting on the chair, bed, etc. as the chair will also be contaminated. If the non-slip tape is on the underside of the board, it means the board cannot be easily wiped clean. If a customer particularly wants non-slip tape, this can be purchased from most hardware shops and the customer can easily put non-slip tape on the Boards.</p>\n<p><strong>Slide the Patient \u2013 Not the Board</strong></p>\n<p>Remember: Slide the patient across the board. Do not slide the board, with patient on top, across the bed. Hand Slots are designed when carrying the board, not for when transferring patients.</p>", "vendor": "Pelican", "product_type": "Living Aids General", "created_at": "2018-11-15T07:41:47+10:00", "handle": "slide-transfer-board-wheelchair-cut-out-gws303882-589", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:03:42+10:00", "published_at": "2019-08-19T14:00:19+10:00", "template_suffix": "", "published_scope": "web", "tags": "brand:Pelican, Brand_Pelican, catID:27, condition:Ageing, condition:Amputee, Condition_Ageing, Condition_Amputee, length:32cm, Length_32cm, product_category:encoded:TRANSFER+AIDS, product_sub_category:encoded:TRANSFER+AIDS, subID:343, swl:250kg, Swl_250kg, weight:2.15kg, Weight_2.15kg", "variants": [{"id": 43245548994734, "product_id": 1909006958705, "title": "Default Title", "price": "265.82", "sku": "589", "position": 1, "compare_at_price": "", "fulfillment_service": "manual", "inventory_management": "shopify", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "created_at": "2022-08-15T05:03:38+10:00", "updated_at": "2022-08-15T05:03:42+10:00", "taxable": false, "barcode": "9349145000119", "grams": 2150, "image_id": null, "weight": 2.15, "weight_unit": "kg", "requires_shipping": true}], "options": [{"id": 2685070573681, "product_id": 1909006958705, "name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "images": [{"id": 23155163988142, "product_id": 1909006958705, "position": 1, "created_at": "2021-01-06T02:15:48+10:00", "updated_at": "2021-01-06T02:15:51+10:00", "alt": "Slide/transfer Board Wheelchair Cut Out [589] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/slidetransfer-board-wheelchair-cut-out-589_1.png?v=1609863351", "variant_ids": []}, {"id": 23155163955374, "product_id": 1909006958705, "position": 2, "created_at": "2021-01-06T02:15:48+10:00", "updated_at": "2021-01-06T02:15:51+10:00", "alt": null, "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/slidetransfer-board-wheelchair-cut-out-589_2.png?v=1609863351", "variant_ids": []}], "image": {"id": 23155163988142, "product_id": 1909006958705, "position": 1, "created_at": "2021-01-06T02:15:48+10:00", "updated_at": "2021-01-06T02:15:51+10:00", "alt": "Slide/transfer Board Wheelchair Cut Out [589] - Think Mobility", "width": 650, "height": 650, "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/slidetransfer-board-wheelchair-cut-out-589_1.png?v=1609863351", "variant_ids": []}}},{"product": {"id": 3981219135601, "title": "Pelican Car Access Strap [592M]", "body_html": "<p>The Pelican Car Access Strap helps people getting in and out of cars.</p>\n<p>The strap is attached to the internal handle fitting inside the car.
